				<Note>These dangerous flying predators resemble orange-furred lions with bat wings in place of forelimbs. Armed with fierce mandibles and the ability to fire blasts of laser energy from their eyes, they are notorious marauders and robbers. Yexils form small nests of two or three individuals. They lie in wait in vantage points overlooking roads and trails, waylaying any who pass by. They generally rob and then devour their victims, but they might trade with those who are well armed. They especially prize cloth , fabric, or other garments, which they find delicious.</Note>
